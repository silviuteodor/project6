 <p> Welcome and enjoy your read!</p>

 <p>I have always been passionate about technology and lately anything related to science and information. One of my latest
    favorite fields of information is Psychology and Human Behavior.</p>
 <p>I am lucky to have really good freinds that have helped me develop extremely advanced communication skills, through long
    sessions of sometimes apparently useless talk, but really fructuous when it comes to creativity and vocabulary
    diversity.</p>
 <p>Being in constant seek of knowledge in as many possible fields, I have found the most important aspect to achieving a
    higher level of understanding is to be opened to change at any time. In a matter of seconds, with the proper read, your
    life core beliefs and understandings can be shattered by newer updated information that can unlock more of your potential when embraced.</p>
